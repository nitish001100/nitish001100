1:- 
When we want to search for all possibilities. 

2:-
And from that all possibilities, you have find your expected one.

3:-
You can use expected output, to make base condition of recursion. 

4:-
Backtracking - never use, when you are considering complexity, in that case, DP(Dynamic programming) is better.
