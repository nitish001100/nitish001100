     A. Two Bags of Potatoes
     time limit per test1 second
     memory limit per test256 megabytes
     inputstandard input
     outputstandard output
     Valera had two bags of potatoes, the first of these bags contains x (x ≥ 1) potatoes, and the second — y (y ≥ 1) potatoes. Valera — very scattered boy, so the first bag of potatoes (it contains x potatoes) Valera lost. Valera remembers that the total amount of potatoes (x + y) in the two bags, firstly, was not gerater than n, and, secondly, was divisible by k.

     Help Valera to determine how many potatoes could be in the first bag. Print all such possible numbers in ascending order.

     Input
     The first line of input contains three integers y, k, n (1 ≤ y, k, n ≤ 109;   ≤ 105).

     Output
     Print the list of whitespace-separated integers — all possible values of x in ascending order. You should print each possible value of x exactly once.

     If there are no such values of x print a single integer -1.
